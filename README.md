# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning on Imbalanced Dataset
This repository is the one of my hands-on projects in order to improve myself. Free dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

This dataset represents transactions that occurred over two days, including 492 fraudulent transactions out of 284,807 total transactions, with 30 features. Specifically, features V1-V28 are the principal components of the raw data, while the 'Time' and 'Amount' columns represent raw data that has not been transformed.
